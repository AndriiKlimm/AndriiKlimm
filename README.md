# Hey, I'm just messing around here 😎 

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub.

This isn’t my main workplace or portfolio—more like a messy shed where I tinker with ideas, try things out, and occasionally build something cool. I started this GitHub when I opened my Upwork account, mostly to stash side projects and experiments.

## 🌱 A bit about me

By day, I’m an Full-Stack Developer nerd with ~20 years of experience in tech (yeah, I’ve been around). But outside of work, I’ve got two main hobbies:

- **Gardening** – I love growing stuff. It’s peaceful, rewarding, and way better than staring at error logs all day.
- **Billiards** – Nothing like lining up a perfect shot and pretending it was totally planned.

I’m also a fan of good convos, random ideas, and just building things for the fun of it.

## 🛠 What’s this GitHub for?
- For Upwork 
- Hobby code
- Project experiments
- Occasional weird little scripts
- Stuff I build when I should probably be outside watering my plants

Don’t expect fancy documentation or polished projects. This is more “what if I…” than “production-ready.”

## ✌️ That’s it

Thanks for dropping by.

If you like gardening, pool, or just geeking out over Development, feel free to say hi. I’m always up for a chat.

Take care—and don’t forget to touch grass. Literally.
